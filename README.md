Homework 6 weather thing was my 6th homework assignment given to my by Georgia Tech and was quite challenging. the features in this program took many days of work to acomplish and was finished beautifully. I would like to thank my instructor for assisting us in making this application.

Some features include: 
- Local storage to save recent searches and click on cities to search them (with clear searches button)
- A complete 5 day forecast with temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index.
- A pre added layout where information is displayed.

The javascript was very challenging when working on the local storage and api key but our instructor helped us in the process of making the applicaiton.
